$array = ["Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.", "Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.", "Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them do not. Miss them do not. Attachment leads to jealously. The shadow of greed, that is.", "Always pass on what you have learned.", "You will know (the good from the bad) when you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.", "[Luke:] I can’t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.", "Yes, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware of the dark side. Anger, fear, aggression; the dark side of the Force are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.", "Powerful you have become, the dark side I sense in you.", "If you end your training now — if you choose the quick and easy path as Vader did — you will become an agent of evil.", "PATIENCE YOU MUST HAVE my young padawan", "Ready are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained. A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things. You are reckless.", "Feel the force!", "Remember, a Jedi’s strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny. Luke... Luke... do not... do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor or suffer your father’s fate you will. Luke, when gone am I... the last of the Jedi will you be. Luke, the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke. There is... another... Sky... walker.", "Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will.", "You must unlearn what you have learned.", "In a dark place we find ourselves, and a little more knowledge lights our way.", "When you look at the dark side, careful you must be. For the dark side looks back.", "Many of the truths that we cling to depend on our point of view.", "Through the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past. Old friends long gone.", "Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.", "The fear of loss is a path to the Dark Side.", "A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind. This one a long time have I watched. All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh. Excitement. Heh. A Jedi craves not these things.", "Do or do not. There is no try.", "You will find only what you bring in.", "May the Force be with you.", "Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hmm? Hmm. And well you should not. For my ally is the Force, and a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. Its energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. You must feel the Force around you; here, between you, me, the tree, the rock, everywhere, yes. Even between the land and the ship.", "Ohhh. Great warrior.Wars not make one great.", "Always two there are, no more, no less. A master and an apprentice.", "Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future..", "I have many children, as you seek you may find that this the last one till he must die before he must reach the becoming of mankind. Many men have failed but i have surpassed their expectation of being a Jedi master.", "Looking? Found someone you have, eh?", "If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.", "You think Yoda stops teaching, just because his student does not want to hear? A teacher Yoda is. Yoda teaches like drunkards drink, like killers kill.", "Luke: What’s in there? Yoda: Only what you take with you.", "Happens to every guy sometimes this does", "This has been a very positive test for Kawasaki,", "Foreplay, cuddling – a Jedi craves not these things", "The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the future is.", "Not if anything to say about it I have", "Named must your fear be before banish it you can.", "Soon will I rest, yes, forever sleep. Earned it I have. Twilight is upon me, soon night must fall.", "Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing ...", "At an end your rule is, and not short enought it was!", "When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good, you will not, hmmmm?", "Your weapons, you will not need them.", "Around the survivors a perimeter create.", "Reckless he is. Matters are worse.", "Much to learn you still have...my old padawan. ... This is just the beginning!", "Ow, ow, OW! On my ear you are!", "Early must I rise. Leave now you must!", "If no mistake have you made, yet losing you are ... a different game you should play", "I was not strong enough to defeat him. Like his master before him, be destroyed, he must.", "Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.", "Ahhh! Yoda’s little friend you seek!", "Mine, or I will help you not!", "Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the senate is, multiply our adversaries will.", "The boy you trained, gone he is. Consumed by Darth Vader.", "Not victory , Obi- Wan. The shroud of the Dark Side has fallen. Begun, this Clone War has.", "Pain, suffering, death I feel. Something terrible has happened. Young Skywalker is in pain. Terrible pain", "Who’s your Jedi master? WHO’S your Jedi Master?", "Stopped they must be; on this all depends. Only a fully-trained Jedi Knight, with the Force as his ally, will conquer Vader and his Emperor.", "Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him you will.", "Save them [Luke and Leia], we must. They are our last hope.", "Urm. Put a shield on my saber I must", "Younglings, younglings gather ’round.", "Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.", "Decide you must, how to serve them best. If you leave now, help them you could; but you would destroy all for which they have fought, and suffered.", "To answer power with power, the Jedi way this is not. In this war, a danger there is, of losing who we are.", "The dark side clouds everything. Impossible to see the light, the future is.", "Secret, shall I tell you? Grand Master of Jedi Order am I. Won this job in a raffle I did, think you? How did you know, how did you know, Master Yoda? Master Yoda knows these things. His job it is.", "And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It’s energy surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches Luke’s shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!", "Clear your mind must be, if you are to find the villains behind this plot.", "Like fire across the galaxy the Clone Wars spread. In league with the wicked Count Dooku, more and more planets slip. Against this threat, upon the Jedi Knights falls the duty to lead the newly formed army of the Republic. And as the heat of war grows, so, to, grows the prowess of one most gifted student of the Force.", "To be Jedi is to face the truth, and choose. Give off light, or darkness, Padawan. Be a candle, or the night.", "On many long journeys have I gone. And waited, too, for others to return from journeys of their own. Some return; some are broken; some come back so different only their names remain.", "At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was!", "I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.", "Control, control, you must learn control!"];
