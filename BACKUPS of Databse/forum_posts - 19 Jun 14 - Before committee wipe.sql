Yes it’s the time of year when we, along with the tramps from TCD DCU and Maynooth, pile onto busses headed for the green pastures of County Cavan for an “intensive training weekend”. For some reason some tramps prefer to refer to it as an intensive liver training weekend, God only knows why… although perhaps it’s because Cavan is where stories are made, then promptly forgotten only to remembered by photo and video evidence days and weeks later. We’ll be holed up in a Cavan sports centre from the 25th to 27th of October solidifying friendships and making stories people will be retelling for the rest of the year, or quite possibly your entire tramp career (I’m still trying to shake the Rihanna thing lads) \r\n\r\nPAYMENT DEADLINE: €45 AT TRAINING NEXT\r\nTUESDAY 22ND \r\n\r\nWe will be taking names and money for Cavan NEXT TUESDAY OCTOBER 22ND!! The cost of the weekend is €35 and an extra €10 if you plan on getting the coach down with the rest of us. Places are filled on a first come first served basis so make sure to get yourself to training on time next Tuesday. When it’s called, at training, that we’re taking money for Cavan it mightn’t be a bad idea to run!\r\n\r\nWhere and when is it? Friday 25th – Sunday 27th of October\r\n\r\nWe’ll be leaving Dublin around 2ish (TBC) and returning around the same time on the Sunday. We’re staying in the luxurious “Killinkere Sports Hall” which provides 17 star accommodation (cough, beds are not provided so bring a sleeping bag)\r\n\r\nHow much is it? €45\r\n\r\nThis covers coach down, alcohol, and food. If you plan on making your own way to Cavan that’ll shave €10 of your fee. Also while food and drink will be provided by us, you should probably bring some of your own too. Especially with regard to the drink, we know what you lot are like.\r\n\r\nDo I really want to go? God yes.\r\n\r\nThe weekend is jam packed with fun. We will have 4 trampolines, an airtrack, a trampette and plenty of mats so everyone can have fun training. But if that is not your thing, you can simply have a laugh with all the other people there. 120 tramps in a single sports centre? It is hard not to make friends. If you need proper convincing, ask literally anyone who has ever been to Cavan. They will tell you how good it is!\r\n\r\n:star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star::star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star: :star:', '892bf648', '5', '275'),

I hold all the weeks dear to me, but there was one camp in particular that i hold close. Camp Little Red Door is for children who currently have or are in remission from cancer. This was the week i cut my hair to donate it to make wigs. My granny died from cancer, i have known many who have lost the battle, and after that week, I met so many brave individuals who have and were battling this awful disease. One of the little ones in my cabin that week was a nine year old girl called Korie. She had cancer of the bone in her knee and had just completed a round of chemo the week before camp. She was on crutches and couldnt walk too far. She used a wheelchair for a lot of the time at camp. Despite this, she was a beautiful and happy girl, who is stronger than i could ever hope to be. She climbed to the top of the climbing tower! \nI have just received news that she is not doing too well. Despite radical treatment, the cancer has spread, and now she has some mets in her lungs. Sadly, Korie is being transferred to a hospice and all active treatment stopped. She has become quite depressed about her condition. A facebook page has been made, where people are being asked to send her letters to cheer her up!\nAND THAT''S WHERE YOU ALL COME IN!\nIm asking if, very kindly, you would all like to be involved in making a video for her, to put a smile on her face, and give her a giggle. At training on tuesday, with the help of Rosie, im going to make signs saying "We love you Korie!" "Fight like a girl!" (Her campaign''s slogan) and other similar things. Much like the photo shoot for redbull, im going to ask ye to pose with them mid-move so we can have some funny shots, and get people to do lots of fun and silly gymnasticy things that will hopefully make her smile!\nYellow is the colour for children with cancer, so if you could all wear something yellow to training also, that would be amazing!\nThank you for this very long read! I just want to give this little lady something to laugh about!\nAny questions, please get on to me!\nYours in love,\nLucy <3', '6dff152e', '0', '0'),

I''ve spent the last few weeks improving the tariff calculator which naturally meant rewriting the whole thing, twice. I''m delighted to say it''s finished and includes an Easter egg for you to discover. You should start looking on the Hub page.\n\nCheers everyone, enjoy the rest of summer.\nYours leaving the web,\nPaul.', '4d6be973', '0', '0'),
