        <h2>Trampoline Fitness</h2>
        <p>We admit that trampolining has it's up's and downs but contrary to popular belief trampolining doesn't just involve bouncing around.</p>

        <p>Fitness and core strength play a huge role in trampolining.</p>

        <p>Remember when you were young bouncing on your trampoline with your
            friends seeing who could bounce higher and daring each other to try to do
            cool new tricks? That is a big part of what goes on in the club and you
            would not believe how much fun it is. You just have to be prepared for
            being unexpectedly exhausted afterwards.</p>

        <p>If you haven't had enough exercise after 4 hours of bouncing a week, don't
            worry. You can expect lots of body conditioning in our squad sessions. This
            can include anything from push ups to sprints to learning how to handstand!
            Talk to Head Coach Colm or Assistant Head Coach Nicole at our regular
            trainings for more info.</p>

        <p>Cardiovascular fitness is also quite important, so running / jogging is very helpful.
            But don't worry, we can make even the biggest couch potato into a fitness junkie in no time!
            Working out on a trampoline can improve your coordination and agility and
            since your musculoskeletal system will be under slight stress, trampolining promotes stronger bones.</p>

        <p>This is the sport for you if you want to work out in a fun, sociable, casual
            way, and our qualified coaches will be glad to take you from your first
            bounce to your first somersault and beyond! One on one coaching means you'll
            progress at your own rate, and within a few sessions you'll feel your fitness
            and strength greatly improving. Keep on eye on the forum for extra training
            and conditioning sessions!</p>

        <h2>Social Side</h2>

            A sports club would be <!-- nothing but --> a sports club without it's social side and boy do we have a social side! We've got it all. From the nights out, weekends away and parties to  bowling, competitions, and a ball. We do it all with shtyle...well most of us do  anyways!
        </p>


        <strong><u>TRAINING</u></strong>
        <p>
            With two training sessions a week, Tuesday 8-10 and Thursday 5-7, you'll make  it from your very first bounce to your first somersault, to infinity and beyond  before you know it. All with the help of our experienced and enthusiastic  coaches! The airtrack and trampette love making appearances too and are always  great craic!

            We'd like to say these are quiet, calm nights where everybody has a delightful  evening,  heads home and turns in early  feeling content with the evenings events. But we'd be lying to you. And lies  make baby Jesus cry.

            <strong><em>Freshers  Night</em></strong> - Our first big night as a club. We  treat all our members, both new and old, to a night they won't forget or will  never remember..depending on how much fun you have! We're so nice we throw you  a party to get you ready for the amazing year to come in the social side of  trampolining. Following quickly on its tail is...
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong><em>Tramp Night</em></strong> - We rent a fancy location in town, shut it down to the public, granting  entrance to only ourselves and our fellow tramps and trampettes from Trinity,  DCU and Maynooth. Craziness and fun ensues!
        </p>

        <p>
            But it doesn't stop there! With games night, refreshers nights and the  occasional trips to the Clubhouse and more set for the year, you're in for a  jam packed year of banter filled events!
        </p>

        <p>At  some stage in these nights, you might see handstands, back-flip races and human  pyramids. Also possibly an ambulance.</p>

        <p><em>Intervarsities,  SSTO, ISTO, Colours, Regionals, Nationals, In-house and mini-comps</em>.  If you manage to hit them all you're either heading to the Olympics or AA. The  best part is that at every competition, there is an official night out. Or two.  Or three. Or four..you get the picture!   These nights out are huge events, specially arranged for us  trampolinists. Location is always somewhere interesting, and the nights are  guaranteed to have special themes and games meaning it's always exciting,  eventful and very, very crazy. Would we want it any other way?</p>

        <p>Look  out for the Scotland trip which includes our habitual trips to the diving  boards and pools and amazing nights out. Not to be forgotten is the ISTO  weekend which is so spectacular, it has won Event of the Year awards in UCD.</p>

        <strong><u>THE WEB...</u></strong>
        <p>We are probably the most active club online. This site is regularly updated with information, photos and other entertaining things like reports from trips  away. That, alongside our Facebook page, ensures you will never miss out on an  important announcement. Our forum deserves a special mention of its own as it  is rare a day goes by without an interesting post by one of our members. Mainly  due to the fear of what will happen if 24 hours do pass....you've been warned.</p>

        <p>If that's not enough, we've got Ask a Tramp who will update you with all the burning questions you have and  pops by to dish the dirt! No one is safe..</p>


        <strong><u>GOING OUT WITH A BANG..</u></strong> <br>
        <p>At the end of the year in the summer we've got the BBQ of all BBQs, the  OMGWTFBYOBBBQB! The day generally starts off with a bit of food and then  anything follows. And we mean anything. In the past there have been  inflatables, slip and slide, beer pong, go karts, saunas, swims in the lake,  even the Gardaí! You cannot miss this event!!</p>
